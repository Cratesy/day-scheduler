# Day Scheduler

## Description

I've been tasked with making a work day scheduler where you can add and save tasks within certain time brackets;

- created html css & js;
- added date using moment;
- added comments to html and js;
- used js to change the classes of each text block so the colour shows if its future, present or past;
- used js to store any text data thats inputted into local
- used js to pull from local any stored data or to create an empty array ready if theres no data
- added icon to save button and when save button is press it stores text data to local
